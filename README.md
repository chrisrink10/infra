# Infrastructure

This repo includes my personal infrastructure configuration files
such as Terraform configurations for making it easier to reproduce
the state of personal projects hosted on cloud providers.

## Terraform Configurations

Terraform configurations for Google Cloud are provided at `terra/gcp/`.
There is a README within that folder further explaining how each GCP
project is laid out and how to add new projects.
